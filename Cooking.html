    <div class="AboutDish"><label>Lentils have been unearthed in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic layers of Franchthi Cave in Greece (9,500 to 13,000 years ago), 
        at Mureybet and Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria at the end of the Mesolithic, and at Jericho, dating to 8000 BC.
         Remains of lentils have been found in royal tombs in the Theban Necropolis, dating to 2400 BC.
         Aristophanes called lentil soup "the most delicious of foods".
         The Roman cookbook Apicius, compiled in the 1st century AD, includes a recipe for lentil soup with chestnuts.</label></div>
    <div class="Recepie"><label>For the red lentil soup, put the oil in a pot and fry the chopped onions until they turn slightly pink.
        Then add flour and continue roasting over low heat.
        If tomato paste is to be used, add tomato paste. After it is roasted, diced carrots and thoroughly washed and drained lentils are added.
        Add water, mix and close the lid of the pot. Cook the soup over medium heat until it boils, then cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and carrots become soft.
        After the soup is cooked, crush it well with a hand blender. If you don't have a blender, you can also pass it through a strainer.
        Add black pepper, salt and optionally cumin and mix. Cook for another 5 minutes and remove from the stove.
        If the consistency is too thick, add some water and boil it for a while.
        Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of butter in a small pan, heat it, add a teaspoon of red pepper powder and remove it from the stove.
        After the lentil soup is placed in a serving bowl, red pepper sauce is drizzled over it and served with a slice of lemon.
